/*
Nick is attracted by everything unconventional. He doesn't like decimal number system any more, 
and he decided to study other number systems. A number system with base b caught his attention. 
Before he starts studying it, he wants to write in his notepad all the numbers of length n without 
leading zeros in this number system. Each page in Nick's notepad has enough space for c numbers exactly. 
Nick writes every suitable number only once, starting with the first clean page and leaving no clean spaces. 
Nick never writes number 0 as he has unpleasant memories about zero divide.
Would you help Nick find out how many numbers will be written on the last page.
